## Jason Bugallon's Personal Portfolio
Hi my name is Jason Bugallon, thank you for 
dropping by and checking the source code of my
personal portfolio. This portfolio was created
with the frontend framework, Angular (v8). I 
created this portfolio in order to showcase my
projects and other stuff about me to potential
employers for them to know whether I'm a good
fit for the position they are hiring for. If you
haven't checked out my actual portfolio yet
then please check it out.
